Ada 2012 provides language support for the [Ada 2012](https://www.adaic.org/ada-resources/standards/ada12) programming language.

## Language Support

- Syntax coloring.
- Code folding for packages, subprograms, and compound statements.
- Code completion for arguments, variables, and subprograms.
- Code completion for package names from the Ada 202x draft standard library.

Future versions should add better support for

- Generic packages,
- Tasking-related constructs, and
- Possibly a language server.
